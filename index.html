                <div class="div-text1">
                    <p>The bass guitar is known for being the lowest-pitched member among its family members. Its
                        appareance is similar to the electric guitar, and has four to six cords. Its popularity has been
                        growing exponencially, you may even know a bass guitar playing without knowing!</p><br>
                    <p>There is a whole debate on how to play a bass guitar. Those who use a pick call the finger-style
                        as purist, when those who use finger-style consider themselves as true bassists and think others
                        aren't real bassists.</p><br>
                    <p>But the whole debate is purely subjective. There is no correct way to play a bass: any method
                        that makes the bass make a sound is valid.</p>
